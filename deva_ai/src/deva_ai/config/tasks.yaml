IngestionTask:
  description: >
    Process the dataset located at file path {file_path} with filename {file_name}.
    Read the file, analyze its content, and provide insights about the dataset.
  expected_output: >
    A dictionary containing the dataset shape, preview of the first few rows,
    and information about column types. Return the results in a valid JSON format.

PreprocessingTask:
  description: >
    Clean and preprocess the dataset located at file path {file_path} with filename {file_name}.
    Apply comprehensive data cleaning techniques including:
    1. Data Type Conversion for numeric columns stored as objects
    2. Handle Missing Values using appropriate imputation strategies
    3. Detect and Remove Duplicate Records
    4. Identify and Drop Irrelevant Columns
    5. Clean Special Characters in Categorical Columns
    6. Advanced Type Inference for Datetime Columns
    7. Outlier Detection and Treatment using IQR method
    8. Handle Outliers by Clipping to appropriate bounds
  expected_output: >
    A dictionary containing preprocessing statistics and information about the
    transformations applied to the dataset. Return the results in a valid JSON format
    and save the preprocessed dataset to a new file with the preprocessing steps applied.
