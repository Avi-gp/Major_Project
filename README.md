### DEVA (Data Explore, Visualize & Analyze) is an AI-powered system that automates the data analytics workflow using AI agents. 
It employs the CrewAI framework for seamless functioning and processing of you data, along with NVIDIA LLaMA 3.3 LLM backing it; providing business insights and visual metrics for AI powered decision making.

# 🏗️ How Does It Work?
## 1. User Uploads a File
Accepts CSV or Excel files.
Done through a simple web interface (Streamlit app).
## 2. AI Agents Take Over
DEVA AI is like a team of digital data scientists. Each agent has a specific job:
Data Ingestion Agent: Reads the file and provides a quick summary.
Data Preprocessing Agent: Cleans the data (removes duplicates, fills missing values, fixes errors).
Feature Engineering Agent: Improves the data quality for deeper analysis.
## 3. AI-Driven Analysis
A smart AI model (from NVIDIA) helps these agents understand and interpret the data.
DEVA AI uses natural language processing to describe trends and insights in plain English.
